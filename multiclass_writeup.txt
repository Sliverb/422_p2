WU1 (10%): Answer questions A, B and C for both OAA and AVA. Questions about “indicative” are open-ended. Any reasonable answers with analysis will be credited.

(A) What words are most indicative of being Sauvignon-Blanc? Which words are most indicative of not being Sauvignon-Blanc? What about Pinot-Noir (label==2)?

code run to generate trees:

oaa = multiclass.OAA(20, lambda: DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3))
ava = multiclass.AVA(20, lambda: DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3))

WineDataSmall.labels[0]
# The 1s mean "likely to be Sauvignon-Blanc" and the 0s mean "likely not to be".
util.showTree(oaa.f[0], WineDataSmall.words)
util.showTree(ava.f[0], WineDataSmall.words)

WineDataSmall.labels[2]
# The 1s mean "likely to be Pinot-Noir" and the 0s mean "likely not to be".
util.showTree(oaa.f[2], WineDataSmall.words)
util.showTree(ava.f[2], WineDataSmall.words)

(B) Train depth 3 decision trees on the full WineData task (with 20 labels). What accuracy do you get? How long does this take (in seconds)? One of my least favorite wines is Viognier -- what words are indicative of this?

(C) Compare the accuracy using zero-one predictions versus using confidence. How much difference does it make?
